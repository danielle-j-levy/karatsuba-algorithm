# Karatsuba Algorithm Implementation üìù

The **Karatsuba algorithm** is a fast multiplication algorithm published by Anatoly Karatsuba in 1962. 

- It is a **divide-and-conquer algorithm** that reduces the multiplication of two $$n$$-digit numbers to **three multiplications** of $$n/2$$-digit numbers.
- By recursively applying this method, the total number of single-digit multiplications is reduced to $$n^{\log_2{3}} \approx n^{1.58}$$.
- It is **asymptotically faster** than the **traditional long multiplication algorithm**, which requires $$n^2$$ single-digit multiplications. 

This efficiency makes it a significant improvement over conventional multiplication techniques.
